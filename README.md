# Applied Data Science Capstone
## Save the Children, Save the City 

This capstone project course gave me a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data.
For my personal project, I used Machine Learning algorithms and data visualization techniques from Folium and Matplotlib
to analyze crime, socioeconomic status, and CPS data in Chicago.  

I learned about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. I learned how to make
RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. 
I also learn how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing
HTML code. I utilized Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which helped me refine my skills for exploring
and analyzing data. I was required to use the Folium library to great maps of geospatial data and to communicate your results and findings.
